# Heart_Failure_Project
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Tasks:
1. What age range is more susceptibe to heart failure?
2. Predict heart failure using the best machine learning algorithm.
3. Deploy the machine learning model using Flask.

## Introduction 
In this project, you will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.

We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.
